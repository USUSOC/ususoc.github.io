## Ready to Join?

We are glad you are on board and ready to get started in the club. Below are some quick ways you can get familiar with the club and get involved.

### Come to a club meeting

Club meetings are the main way everyone can participate in the club. Each week, we meet in the Huntsman on the Utah State Logan campus. Our meetings take place at 7 pm Tuesday nights in room HH360. These meetings will be described each week in much more detail on our Discord server, so keep reading to get on there.

### Connect with us on Discord

Discord is our main format for communication. We send out announcements, post meeting details, help answer questions members have, chat about all things cyber, and grow our community. 

### Meet the club Leadership Team

This is the club leadership team. blah blah blah, (we will reference a picture)
