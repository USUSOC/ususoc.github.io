We are THE cybersecurity club at Utah State University. We are going through some exciting rapid expansion and changes, so things may continue to look different as
we continue making this club the best place for cyber geeks to come together. Our official name is **The Student Organization for Cybersecurity or S.O.C.**, 
reflecting our desire to be an official and recognized organization while referencing a term known as a centralized point for all things cybersecurity within an organization.

## Activities

Here in S.O.C., we participate in many activities each semester (yes, including the Summer semester). This upcoming academic year, we plan to participate in the National Cyber League, HTB University CTF, have various in-house competitions, hear from distinguished guest speakers from all over the US, have career-building nights, and much more.

## Who Can Participate?

Short answer: **ANYONE!!**


Everyone in the club understands cybersecurity is challenging, and nobody here is an "expert." Everyone who you will meet in the club comes to learn and get better. Additionally, we would love for "non-cyber" people to come and see what cybersecurity is really all about. We believe cybersecurity is an essential and growing part of everyone's life, so foundational knowledge is critical. 


Also, for those competitions you read about above, we participate in competitions with beginner-friendly challenges, so no matter your skill level, you will succeed and grow in your knowledge.


So, once again, who can participate? **ANYONE!!**

## Club Benefits

Oh yes, we do have some unofficial club benefits.

* Improved cybersecurity skills
* Grow your professional network with future cyber professionals

* Be in the know about Cybersecurity internship/job opportunities
* The club will cover fees for all competitions in which the club participates
