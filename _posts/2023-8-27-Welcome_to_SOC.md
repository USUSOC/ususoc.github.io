## A Brief Introduction

Hello! 


You may have heard rumors about a cybersecurity club around Utah State. Well, we are it! There have been many exciting changes that have occurred in the last few months, and there will be more coming. We are excited to have as much momentum as we have right now and hope all the cybersecurity people at Utah State can finally all come together in this club. We know there is serious talent on campus, and we want to concentrate it into an awesome community. 


We invite you to explore this website to get started in the club, check out upcoming events, check out some learning resources, get involved, and stay tuned for future posts. 


If you are ready to get involved check out our [Quick Start Guide.](https://ususoc.github.io/docs/quick-start-guide/)


See you in cyberspace! [and our weekly meetings ;)]


The S.O.C. Leadership Team
